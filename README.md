# Multi-LLM Agile Assistant
## SE4485 Software Engineering Project

The Multi-LLM Agile Assistant is a program designed to assist software teams with the 
production of draft deliverables during the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This
project runs as a web application that connects to a backend prompt library and LLM server(s).

### Environment Setup
Development setup is streamlined with the help of several shell scripts. Anyone starting
with a new clone of the project should run 'setup.bat' or 'setup.sh' relevant to their
workstation operating system.

'''
./setup.bat
'''

This command will setup a virtual environment for the project packages and download and
install all of the neccessary python packages.
